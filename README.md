## Technologies used

### 1. TensorFlow and Keras for Model Building and Prediction 

- **TensorFlow Lite Interpreter**: The TensorFlow Lite Interpreter is used to load our pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for emotion recognition from audio data.

- **Keras**: An open-source neural network library written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks. It runs on top of TensorFlow and is integrated directly into TensorFlow as tf.keras. It simplifies many aspects of creating and compiling a model, adding layers, and setting up multi-input/output models.

###  2. Librosa for Audio Processing

- **Librosa**: We utilized `librosa` to load audio files, fix the audio length to the size that the model expects, and to extract audio features.


### 3. Machine Learning Model Workflow 

The core workflow in our app involves:

- Capturing audio input from the user via the Streamlit interface.
Preprocessing the audio input using Librosa to extract relevant features.
- Using the pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model to predict the emotion from the extracted audio features.
- Visualizing the predictions and providing insights into the detected emotions over time.

### 4. Others

- **Streamlit**: It serves as the backbone of our web app, providing a framework to create our user interface, handle interactions with the user (such as button clicks and audio recording), and display data and plots.
 
- **NumPy**: We used NumPy for numerical operations on arrays, such as reshaping arrays to match the input requirements of the machine learning model.
 
- **st_audiorec**: This is a Streamlit component that allows audio recording and downloading within the Streamlit app.
 
- **Matplotlib**: We used `Matplotlib` for creating visualizations such as pie charts, line plots, and histograms.
 
- **Seaborn**: We used `Seaborn` to enhance the visualizations, making them more aesthetically pleasing with more color palettes.
 
- **Pandas**: We used Pandas for organizing the prediction results into a structured format, which can then be easily plotted and for handling timestamps and numerical data together.
 
 
## What problems you are trying to solve

The problem we want to solve is enabling automatic mood tracking and prediction using speech tone analysis for bipolar disorder individuals. This aims to understand emotional states by listening to the nuances in someone's voice, acting as a support mechanism.
 
## How to run
 
Open the terminal and run the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
